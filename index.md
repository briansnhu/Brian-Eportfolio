<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Since January 2018, I've been with SNHU Computer Science. Before I went to Southern New Hampshire university as a student in computer science, I began school at the University of Oklahoma in 2000. My ultimate course in the computer science curriculum I'm now planning to finish and eventually graduate.</p>

<h2 id="educational-reflection">Educational Reflection</h2>

<p>During this program, I learned a lot of things. First of all, I think specificity is a vital skill even though it's not specifically relevant to the programme. My code was not compiled several times because of a small error or mistake in the code. Detailed focus is aimed at the code review definition. We should help our colleagues study our code by code tests and look for errors we might have missed. Like revising a script, it will allow you to spot errors from a fresh pair of eyes. Another definition I studied is one of research and technique. Testing becomes more difficult as a project becomes bigger and is important for ensuring a program works. Taking a tester's attitude is also a transition. We ought to figure out if anything can be bridged to recognize the faults in our project. Finally, it was eye-opening to hear the App Creation Lifecycle. I never truly thought of collaborating for a team on a large-scale project, but there are many logistics involved with preparing and collaboration with colleagues. Furthermore, it is important to consider the customer's desires and convert them into instructions for employees.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio-summary">Portfolio Summary</h2>

<p>All the courses in computer science have helped me learn the expertise and knowledge required to position myself for a career in this field. CS-250 told me a lot about the life cycle of the software production and how important consumer contact is. A perfect lesson on data structures and algorithms was CS-260. CS-310 taught me the fundamental concepts of cooperation and how cooperation is needed for large-scale projects. CS-330 was a complex computer graphics knowledge survey. CS-340 was helpful to me and helped me understand how to build and use databases.</p>

<p>Although I did not only study these lessons, I thought these were at least a handful of the most important classes in the curriculum. I discovered much I did not originally know from these lessons. That is why I decided to integrate into my portfolio the lessons I have learned. My first change follows straight from my CS-330 final project and aims to make the object more dynamic. I have decided to present my expertise in dealing on more complicated issues. My second improvement is based on the final project of my IT-145. I have opted to collaborate with the project to rewrite it in various languages by adding data structures and sorting algorithms to the mix and apply what I learnt from CS-250. In end, both DAT-220 and CS-340 have my third update. I decided to take the skills of MongoDB I learned in CS-340 with the data presented by DAT-220, and create an HTML gui to communicate with the data.</p>

<p>These objects represent three different projects overall and do not generally mesh together well. However, I believe they encourage me to show what I have experienced during the program together. I assume my learning and competence in this curriculum have strengthened in these three projects.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-for-the-future">Preparing For The Future</h2>

<p>I don't really rely on programming skills for my securityÂ career. These skills could however, provide new opportunities in the future. I could move to another store by showing my skills and obtain a further planning background with my curriculum vitae. My job planning is up in the air right now. I've left in the service less than one year, so I have no clear plans until I get out. The most possible conclusion is that I will re-enroll for four more years. This isn't perfect for me because four more years is more than I would want at the moment, but I would like to have at least job stability. Since the preparation potential in the military deals with data collection, I aim to work on this in the near future and attempt to specialize in database processing.</p>
