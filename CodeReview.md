<p><strong>Category One: Software Engineering/Design</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to deal on my final CS 330 project for this category. This object was C++ code, which OpenGL used for a 3-dimensional object rendering. My aim to upgrade this device is to make the model more complicated, in this case a beverage mug, and to incorporate other items, textures and lighting to replicate a setting. My intention is also to provide additional camera functions to the consumer. This improvement would show my ability to make code more stable and effective.
</p>

<p><strong>Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to collaborate on my IT 145 Final Project for this category. This code was a basic authentication scheme for a Java zoo. This authentication method will read user inputs and search to see if those inputs corresponded to a text file. My plan is to upgrade this code by rewriting the code and adding graphical elements to the user in Visual Basic. In addition, I want to build on the various functions initially developed into the structure and make them do different things. I also plan to use an array to store data on different animal types and incorporate a sorting function in this array to increase access times. This shows my ability to authenticate security flaws and helps me to use my code with algorithms.  
</p>

<p><strong>Category Three: Databases</strong></p>

<p>I decided to work with the DAT 220 Final Project data file for this category. These details apply to consumers with physical and online presence in a particular shop. I want to create a MongoDB gui for this artifact so that a user can easily search for data within the file. Some of the inquiries I want to do are to look for consumer data by State, area, old age brackets, and so forth in each sector.
