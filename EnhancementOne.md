<p>My final CS 330 Project was built in early April 2020, and was used for software engineering/design enhancement. This code originally aimed to display my ability to create a daily object in 3-dimensional space with C++ and OpenGL.. I wanted to make a cup and to add simple light and metal texture to my cup for my CS 330 Final.</p>

<p>It reveals my abilities to use C++ and my ability to make and object by measuring vertices and drawing hundreds of triangles and I choose to have that item in my portfolio. Another explanation why I selected this item is that I thought it was especially fascinating at the time and had looked to improve my code not long after the original submission was received. This proved useful and for the purposes of this class I could use what I knew. My changes to this code include lighting change, enhancing the complexity of the object being rendered and designing and texturing the environment. In general I think that the upgrade of this item reflects my ability to execute a design solution, solve conceptual challenges and reach an objective.</p>

<p>Although I learned how to better this artifact not so long after it was submitted in the first place, I held it on my hand for a long time. I then had to take a while to get to know the OpenGL pipeline and how I intended to develop my concept. Fortunately, I had my notes on my initially intended vertices, but eventually I was disassembled because of the complexities and the potential exceedance of the original 1000 triangles cap. I have had to learn how to apply various textures in addition to recreating my model and rework the lighting. I eventually decided to combine the different textures into a single file, but I wanted to go back to all the vertices and rework them.</p>
