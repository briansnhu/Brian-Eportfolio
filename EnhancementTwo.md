<p>My final project for IT 145 was chosen and built in December 2018 for developing algorithms and data structures. This code originally intended to illustrate my ability to construct a basic authentication for a zoo by using Java. The initial code is executed from an interface to a command-line, asks a user to log in and tests if their data fits data contained in a text file. My initial ideas for upgrading this technology were to rewrite the code in Visual Basic, add Interface objects and store data with arrays.</p>

<p>In my portfolio, I have opted to add this artifact as I have learnt from CS 260 â€“ data structure and algorithms, which helps me to take the basic concept from the early course and improve it. I agree that using a more simple artifact permitted greater versatility in the choice of improvements. As previously stated, my changes to the code include the inclusion of GUI elements and the growth in user experience. Animal data are processed and handled with arrays and ArrayLists, and the data is controlled with a bubble sort in the array. I have planned to create a structure for storing the data and properties of animals.</p>

<p>Visual Basic was my very first programming language, but for nostalgic reasons I opted to work with it. But after high school I haven't used it, so I would take a long time to learn to use it. I served in Visual Studio too an IDE separate from what I am used to. I know that Visual Simple Arraylists have an incorporated sorting system and I have therefore developed a separate sub process to incorporate a bubble sort logic. Moreover it is somewhat more difficult to grasp the complexities of Visual Basic than I initially anticipated. Overall, I was able to appreciate this development and incorporate my preferred improvements with relative ease.</p>
