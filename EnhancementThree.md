<h2 id="enhancement-three-databases">Enhancement Three: Databases</h2>
<p>I selected DAT 220 data which was used in April 2020 for the update of the Database. This data reflect the details of customers gathered from a single store and used initially for data mining. These data were analyzed using JMP to verify the statistically relevant data that were gathered, so that the organization could sell its goods more efficiently. My aim to upgrade this code was to import data to a MongoDB database and to create an HTML interface to allow a user to communicate with data inside the database.</p>

<p>It helps me to create my own product for manipulating data from a previous class, and I wanted to integrate this artifact into my portfolio. I had to go a little deeper with my analysis of CS 340. The final assignment of this class consisted of using MongoDB and constructing a RESTful API for manipulation of data inside a database by the user. The final project was introduced using Python from the command line gui. I selected the web application platform Node.js Express to introduce a RESTful API for the database enhancement.</p>

<p>In addition, there was much new experience. 4The final project for CS 340 was my first experience with MongoDB and REST API. I also had to rapidly collect Javascript, Jade, and CSS because I was using Express, both of which I have never used before. I spent a lot of time discussing the changes I needed to do relative to the other improvements, which I feel was a positive thing because I was able to understand a lot.. Since much of this is new to me however, I believe my execution might and could have rendered a lot of shortcomings. However, I think it was a decent first step in developing a MongoDB gui.</p>
